## 0 - Usage

The code can be run both in 

  **batch mode** `eliLaBr commands`, or
  
  **interactive mode**
- `eliLaBr dumb` start a console interactive terminal;
- `eliLaBr` start a graphical Qt OpenGL interactive terminal.

In **interactive mode**, user should start with `control/execute commands`.

### *`commands`* macrofile

  This is the main macrofile of **eliLaBr** code.
  Depending on the purpose, it is recommended to perform the following changes to this macrofile:
  - when we are interested to launch **eliLaBr** in *batch mode* we should comment
  ```
  #/control/execute gui.mac
  #/control/execute vis1.mac
  ```
  and uncomment
  ```
  /run/beamOn #(int)NumberOfEvents
  ```
  - when we are interested to run **eliLaBr** in *interactive mode* we should do the other way arround:
  ```
  /control/execute gui.mac
  /control/execute vis1.mac
  #/run/beamOn #(int)NumberOfEvents
  ```
